# 🔎 Linear Search in Java

This repository contains a simple **Java program** to perform **linear search** on an array.  
It demonstrates basic **array handling**, **user input**, and **search algorithms** in Java.

---

## 🧠 Overview

- **Language:** Java  
- **Topic:** Arrays, Searching Algorithm  
- **Algorithm Used:** Linear Search (Sequential Search)  
- **Purpose:** Learn and practice basic array operations and search techniques in Java.

## 📂 File Structure

```

Search1/
└── Search1.java

```

---

## 💻 Program Description

The program allows the user to:

1. Input the **size of the array**.  
2. Enter **array elements**.  
3. Enter a **key element** to search.  
4. Perform **linear search** and display whether the element is **found** or **not found**.

## 📝 Example Run

```

Enter the size of Array: 5
Enter the value for 0 th index: 10
Enter the value for 1 th index: 20
Enter the value for 2 th index: 30
Enter the value for 3 th index: 40
Enter the value for 4 th index: 50
Enter the Element to Search: 30
Element Found

```
```

Enter the size of Array: 3
Enter the value for 0 th index: 1
Enter the value for 1 th index: 2
Enter the value for 2 th index: 3
Enter the Element to Search: 5
Element NOT Found

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Search1.git
````

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:

```bash
cd Search1
```

3. **Compile the program**:

```bash
javac Search1.java
```

4. **Run the program**:

```bash
java Search1
```

## 📌 Key Concepts

* **Static Arrays** – Fixed-size array declared at runtime.
* **Linear Search Algorithm** – Sequentially checks each element to find the key.
* **Scanner Class** – Takes user input from console.
* **Methods** – `inputsToArray()` for input and `linearSearch()` for search functionality.
